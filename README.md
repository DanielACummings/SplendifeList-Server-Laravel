    - `sudo mysql -u root`
    - `CREATE USER 'laravel'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'laravel';`
    - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON laravel.* TO 'laravel'@'localhost';`

        - `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'port';`


#### Errors
- "SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused (Connection: mysql, SQL...""
    - If the connection string username and password are correct, check in MySQL if the user's authentication is set to the default of the auth_socket plugin
    - If it is, change it to mysql_native_password
    - Using auth_socket requires that the username in the connection string matches that of the user running the program
